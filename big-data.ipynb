        "Vegetation has the potential to provide many ecosystem services in urban areas, such as cleaner air and water and flood mitigation. However, the results are mixed on relationships between a simple measurement of vegetation cover (such as average NDVI, a measurement of vegetation health) and human health. We do, however, find relationships between landscape metrics that attempt to quantify the connectivity and structure of greenspace and human health. These types of metrics include mean patch size, edge density, and fragmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you will write code to calculate patch, edge, and fragmentation statistics about urban greenspace in Chicago. These statistics should be reflective of the connectivity and spread of urban greenspace, which are important for ecosystem function and access. You will then use a linear model to identify statistically significant correlations between the distribution of greenspace and health data compiled by the US Center for Disease Control.\n",

The authors also discuss the influence of scale (e.g. the resolution of the imagery) on these relationships, which is important for this case study.\n",
